# Deploy-Game-Dise

My Semester 6 Mini Project - A gaming application that helps users play Sudoku and Tic Tac Toe

# Project Description:
Software game is a kind of application that is used not only for entertainment, but also for serious purposes that can be applied to different domains such as education, business, and health care. The multidisciplinary nature of the game development processes that combine sound, art, control systems, artificial intelligence (AI), and human factors, makes the software game development practice different from traditional software development. The invention of touch screen mobiles and the ease of storing large amounts of data in them, the gaming industry is one the industries that has evolved significantly over the years. Tic-Tac-Toe game is played on a three-by-three board. The game of tic-tac-toe is a game of predictability. The moves that are believed to be important are highly predictable. This game has 2 modes of playing: a. Play against a computer (AI Agent), b. Play against another Player. Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In classic sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 sub grids that compose the grid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. In GameDise, the user can select between two games which are Sudoku and Tic Tac Toe. In both the games the user needs to enter the name which is then stored in the Firebase and the user can further play the desired game.
